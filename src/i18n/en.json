      "step5": "After pressing the \"Start\" button, a yellow row will appear in the grid - this is the current start minute. The row will automatically move down as the minutes pass, and the screen will automatically scroll after it.

In this window: a quick tap on a participant's cell marks them as \"entered\" (the cell will turn green), a long press opens a menu where you can set the \"absent\" status, reset the status, or set a start time from the list of available times. If a participant has a start time set, it is displayed inside the cell under the name. Participants without a start time remain in this list and do not appear in the main grid, even if a start time is set for them.",
      "step7": "If the secretary sent you an updated file with the start grid (for example, new participants were added or participant groups were changed), you can update the current project. Open the menu (three dots in the bottom right corner) and select \"Update from File\". Select the new file that the secretary sent you. The application will check that this is the same competition file and update the grid. All your participant marks will be saved if their start minute is less than the current timer time. Marks for participants with later start times will be reset. The timer will continue to work as before - if it was at minute 4, it will remain at minute 4.",
      "step8": "If for some reason you need to temporarily stop the start (for example, a technical problem), open the menu (three dots in the bottom right corner) and press \"Finish\". The timer will stop. When you can continue, press the \"Start\" button at the top of the screen again. Then in the menu, select \"Reset Timer to Row N\" and specify which minute you need to return to. IMPORTANT: when you reset the timer to an earlier minute, all participant marks that were made after that minute will disappear. For example, if you marked a participant at minute 21 as \"absent\", and then returned the timer to minute 19, the mark at minute 21 will disappear.",
      "step9": "When all participants have started, open the menu (three dots in the bottom right corner) and press \"Report\". You will see a list of all late and absent participants. To send this information to the secretary, press the \"Export\" button at the top of the report page."
