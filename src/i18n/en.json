In the application, press the large \"Create Project\" button. Then select the file that the secretary sent you.",
      "step3": "A start grid will appear on the screen - a table with participants. Check if it matches your paper protocol. Is everything correct?",
      "step4": "Until you press the \"Start\" button, you will not be able to mark participants. This is done on purpose to avoid accidental marks. When you need to start launching participants into the start area (usually 3-5 minutes before the first participant's start), press the large \"Start\" button under the competition name.",
      "step5": "After pressing the \"Start\" button, a yellow row will appear in the grid - this is the current start minute. The row will automatically move down as the minutes pass, and the screen will automatically scroll after it. If automatic scrolling interferes with you, you can turn it off: press the three dots in the bottom right corner of the screen (this is the menu), then find \"Auto scroll\" and turn it off.",

      "step6c": "If a participant did not come and their start minute has already passed, press their number and hold your finger. In the menu that appears, select \"Absent\". The number will turn red.",
      "step6d": "If a participant was late and came after their start minute, find their number in the grid. Press the number and hold your finger, then select \"Late\". The number will turn orange.",
      "step7": "If for some reason you need to temporarily stop the start (for example, a technical problem), open the menu (three dots in the bottom right corner) and press \"Finish\". The timer will stop. When you can continue, press the \"Start\" button at the top of the screen again. Then in the menu, select \"Reset Timer to Row N\" and specify which minute you need to return to. IMPORTANT: when you reset the timer to an earlier minute, all participant marks that were made after that minute will disappear. For example, if you marked a participant at minute 21 as \"absent\", and then returned the timer to minute 19, the mark at minute 21 will disappear.",
      "step8": "When all participants have started, open the menu (three dots in the bottom right corner) and press \"Report\". You will see a list of all late and absent participants. To send this information to the secretary, press the \"Export\" button at the top of the report page."
